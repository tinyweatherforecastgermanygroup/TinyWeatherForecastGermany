Gadgetbridge supprt:
- changed timestamp in Gadgetbridge API from polling time to forecast time; this should solve the issue of some wearables complaining about missing weather info

- fixed gadgetbridge last update time unknown at first app launch
- fixed wearables not displaying weather condition text properly
